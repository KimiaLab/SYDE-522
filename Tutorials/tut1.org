* Tutorial 1

** What's expected?

- Work through various machine learning algorithms using simple toy data-sets.
- Leverage Python packages for machine learning and data science.
- Perform practical experiments using whats is taught in the lectures.
- Understand the development and combination of machine learning methods to tackle a given problem.
- Explore visualization techniques used in data science.
- Discover what deep learning is all about.
- Explore GPU and parallel computing for ML algorithms in Python.
- Explore LaTeX for writing scientific paper.

** About me

I'm Shivam Kalra, MASc. candidate under supervision of *Prof. Hamid R.
Tizhoosh*. My research interests are in *Deep learning* and *evolutionary
algorithms*. I mostly work with *Python* for my research. Fanboy of Arch Linux,
Awesome WM and Emacs.

** Quick survey

** Today's agenda
- Explore some open data-sets (UCI and Kaggle)
- Explore some Kaggle competitions
- Explore sample projects from past years
- Setup Python environment and some packages

** Why open data-sets
- Need data-sets to work with any machine learning algorithms
- Compare your approach with others

** Resources for open data-sets


- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
- https://www.data.gov/
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- Twitter streaming API

** General outline of final project

1) Find a problem that is not solved properly, correctly, efficiently
2) Analyze the problem (is data-set available?)
3) Select an approach: decision tree, fuzzy logic, reinforcement learning, deep
   learning.
4) Justify (empirically) the choice of approach over other possibilities.
5) Design/customize (fine-tuning, parameter selection) the approach for the
   problem.
6) Train your ML models (use bagging, K-fold validation and etc)
7) Fine tune your models for best AUC.
8) Try it on testing data (*you cannot you test data for training NO NO NO*)
9) Compare results with others, ensemble models for better accuracy/results.

** Finding the problem for final project
- Go through previous year projects on learn: =Course Project >> Sample Projects=
  =for SYDE 522=
- Project could be in any field:
  - Sports
  - Audio/Music/Multimedia
  - Computer Vision
  - Finance/Commerce
  - Natural Language Processing/Sentiment Analysis
  - Image Retrieval (talk to Prof. Tizhoosh or me for the data-set)
  - Visualization
- Look for interesting Kaggle data-sets.

** Environment

We will be using =Python= for the tutorials, but you're free to use any language
or OS for the final project work.

- Python2.7
- Packages for now: =matplotlib=, =scikit-learn=, =numpy=, =scipy=, =pandas=,
  =jupyter=

** Setup instruction for Python Environment

I encourage to use Linux environment as it has better support for Deep Learning
libraries.

I highly recommend to use =Python 2.7= to be compatible with my setup. 

I'll keep the updated list of packages to be installed in [[requirements.txt]]. You
may run following to install them.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip install -r requirement.txt
#+END_SRC

Look at following instruction below for installation on *Linux environment*:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # Install virtualenv either use OS package manager or pip
  pip install --user virtualenv

  # Usually --user flag puts the binary files in ~/.local/bin
  # Make sure ~/.local/bin is in path to use virtualenv

  # make sure virtualenv is in the PATH if not then see if it is installed
  # in ~/.local/bin, if not then do global installation of virtualenv (removing
  # -- user)
  which virtualenv


  # Now, you have virtualenv, create a empty folder where you would work in all
  # the tutorials
  mkdir tutorials-syde-522
  cd tutorials-syde-522

  # Create virtual environment
  # -p takes path of python2.7 executable as argument (I'm using my system wide
  # install Python 2.7)
  # virtualenv -p <PYTHON EXECUTABLE PATH> <ENVIRONMENT NAME>
  virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 syde-522-env

  # Above should create a directory syde-522-env with minimal python installed
  # into it, you can activate that environment by
  source syde-522-env/bin/activate

  # Tada!! You are in brand new python environment
  # Make as much mess you want and you can always delete the syde-522-env folder
  # and create brand new one again!!

  # Install the packages we need for the tutorials
  # Get requirements.txt file from the course repository
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shivamkalra/syde-522/master/Tutorials/requirements.txt

  # Install all the packages
  pip install -r requirements.txt

#+END_SRC

For *Windows environment* (though I personally recommend to install Linux/Ubuntu on
openbox or virtualization software and do your setup there).

- You may use anaconda https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
- Make sure you download Python 2.7
- Install all required packages using =conda shell=.
